Add the following scripts in `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
},
```

> [!TIP]
>
> You can use Turbopack by appending `--turbopack` flag in `dev` command

You can start the server in development mode with the following command
according to your package manager:

```sh npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

or in production mode:

```sh npm2yarn
npm run build
npm run start
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you're not familiar with Next.js, note that development mode is
> significantly slower since Next.js compiles every page you navigate to.

### Add Next.js Config

Create the following `next.config.mjs` file in your project's root directory:

```js filename="next.config.mjs"
import nextra from 'nextra'

const withNextra = nextra({
  // ... Other Nextra config options
})

// You can include other Next.js configuration options here, in addition to Nextra settings:
export default withNextra({
  // ... Other Next.js config options
})
```

With the above configuration, Nextra can handle Markdown files in your Next.js
project, with the specified theme. Other Nextra configurations can be found in
[Guide](/docs/guide).
