# Usage with Turbopack `next dev --turbo`

1. mention `.jsx`/`.tsx` (and even `.ts` for someone?) extension doesn't work
   for `mdx-components` file
1. mention installation `shiki` as dependency if using `compileMdx` somewhere
   (version should match Nextra's version)
1. mention relative images fails to load on development mode (Turbopack bug, not
   affect production, since Webpack is still used there)
1. mention about serializable options only

```
Error: loader nextra/loader for match "./{src/app,app}/**/page.{md,mdx}" does not have serializable options.
Ensure that options passed are plain JavaScript objects and values.
```

1. fix resourceQuery `?locale=` for Webpack throws error
