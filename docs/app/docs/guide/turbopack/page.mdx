# Usage with Turbopack `next dev --turbo`

1. mention `.jsx`/`.tsx` extension doesn't work for `mdx-components` file
1. mention installation `shiki` as dependency if using `compileMdx` somewhere
   (version should match Nextra's version)
1. mention relative images fails to load on development mode (Turbopack bug, not
   affect production, since Webpack is still used there)
