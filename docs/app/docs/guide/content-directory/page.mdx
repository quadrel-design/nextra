# `content` Directory

Migrate your Pages Router site with minimal changes using this mode. Follow these steps:

<Steps>

<h4>Rename your `pages` folder to `content`</h4>

You can keep `content` directory in root of your project, or in `src` directory.

<h4>Set `contentDirBasePath` option in `next.config` file (_optional_)</h4>

If you want to serve your content from a different path, you can set `contentDirBasePath` option:

```js filename="next.config.mjs" {4}
import nextra from 'nextra'

const withNextra = nextra({
  contentDirBasePath: '/docs' // Or even nested e.g. `/docs/advanced`
})
```

<h4>Add `[[...mdxPath]]/page.jsx` file</h4>

Place this file in `app` directory with
[the following content](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/blob/d5cb1bc0e84494cbcc8decbae56fb091ce9999f0/examples/docs/app/%5B%5B...mdxPath%5D%5D/page.jsx),
you should get the following structure:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="app" open>
    <FileTree.File name="layout.jsx" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="[[...mdxPath]]" open active>
      <FileTree.File name="page.jsx" active />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.Folder name="content" open>
    <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="docs" open>
      <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
      <FileTree.File name="getting-started.mdx" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

  **Tip**

  Consider the single catch-all route `[[...mdxPath]]/page.jsx` as a gateway to your `content`
  directory.

  If you set `contentDirBasePath` option in `next.config` file, you should put
  `[[...mdxPath]]/page.jsx` in the corresponding directory.

  **Note**

  Many existing solutions such as
  [Refreshing the Next.js App Router When Your Markdown Content Changes](https://steveruiz.me/posts/nextjs-refresh-content)
  rely on extra dependencies like `concurrently` and `ws`. These approaches include
  [Dan Abramov workaround with `<AutoRefresh>` component and dev web socket server](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-remote-watch/issues/42#issuecomment-1794052655).

  Nextra's content mode delivers a streamlined solution right out of the box:

  - you don't need to install unnecessary dependencies
  - you don't need to restart your server on changes in `content` directory
  - hot reloading works out of the box
  - you can use `import` statements in MDX files and
  [static images](https://nextra.site/docs/guide/image#static-image) works as well

  Checkout Nextra's
  [docs website](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/tree/d5cb1bc0e84494cbcc8decbae56fb091ce9999f0/examples/docs)
  and
  [i18n website example](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/tree/d5cb1bc0e84494cbcc8decbae56fb091ce9999f0/examples/swr-site).

</Steps>

> [!TIP]
>
> You can also put your `content` directory under [the `src` directory](./src-directory).
