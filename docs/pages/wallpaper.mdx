# Sponsored Wallpapers

Sponsored Wallpapers are in the form of high-resolution images and are designed to capture the attention of the user as soon as they open a new tab in their browser. They can be used to promote products, services, or brands and can include interactive elements such as buttons or links to drive user engagement. This type of ad format can be effective in increasing brand awareness and driving traffic to a website or landing page.

Sponsored Wallpapers are displayed in rotation with background images on **Slice**. They are full-screen, providing a 100% share-of-voice and include a clickable call-to-action.
