# Built-ins

import { Cards } from 'nextra/components'
import { CardsIcon } from '../../../components/icons'

The Nextra Docs Theme includes a couple of built-in components that you can use
to better style your documentation:

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<CardsIcon />}
    title="Bleed"
    href="/docs/docs-theme/built-ins/bleed"
  />
</Cards>
