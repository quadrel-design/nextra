Playground components allow you to write Nextra compatible MDX that renders only on the client. It's modeled after the functionality found in [MDX Playground](https://mdxjs.com/playground).

In some instances where remote loading MDX is not an option, this may work as a great alternative.

Here's an example of a codeblock.

\`\`\`ts
console.log("Hello world, this is a playground component!");
\`\`\`

## Caveats

Due to the purely client-side nature of this component, there are some features (namely several remark plugins) that will not work due to their dependence on \`'path'\` which is only available in a server-side context. Here are some examples below:

<br />

- [x] Table of Contents
- [x] Frontmatter
- [x] Mermaid.js

\`\`\`mermaid
graph TD;
subgraph AA [Consumers]
A[Mobile app];
B[Web app];
C[Node.js client];
end
subgraph BB [Services]
E[REST API];
F[GraphQL API];
G[SOAP API];
end
Z[GraphQL API];
A --> Z;
B --> Z;
C --> Z;
Z --> E;
Z --> F;
Z --> G;
\`\`\`

  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mt-6">
      <textarea
        value={rawMdx}
        onChange={event => setRawMdx(event.target.value)}
        className={cn(
          '_rounded-lg _px-3 _py-2',
          '_bg-black/[.05] dark:_bg-gray-50/10',
          'resize-none [field-sizing:content] outline-none focus:ring'
        )}
      />
      <div>
        <Playground
          fallback={
            <div className="flex h-full items-center justify-center text-4xl">
              Loading playground...
            </div>
          }
          source={rawMdx}
          components={{ Mermaid }}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

# Playground

<Demo />

## Usage

```mdx
import { Playground } from 'nextra/components'

# Playground

Below is a playground component. It mixes into the rest of your MDX perfectly.

<Playground source="## Hello world" />
```

You may also specify a fallback component like so:

```mdx
import { Playground } from 'nextra/components'

<Playground
  source="## Hello world"
  fallback={<div>Loading playground...</div>}
/>
```
