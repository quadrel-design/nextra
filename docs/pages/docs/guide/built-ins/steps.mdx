# Steps Component

A built-in component to turn a numbered list into a visual representation of
steps.

## Example

<Steps>

### This is the first step

This is the first step description.

### This is the second step

This is the second step description.

### This is the third step

This is the third step description.

</Steps>

## Usage

Wrap a set of markdown h3 headings with the `Steps` component to turn them into
visual steps.

<Steps>

### Step 1

Content for step 1.

### Step 2

Contents for step 2.

</Steps>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```mdx
import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>
### Step 1

Contents for step 1.

### Step 2

Contents for step 2.
</Steps>
```

If you want to exclude the steps from the table of contents, replace the markdown h3 headings with `{<h3>Title</h3>}`.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```mdx
import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>
{<h3>Step 1</h3>}

Contents for step 1.

{<h3>Step 2</h3>}

Contents for step 2.
</Steps>
```
