# Push notifications

Push notifications are a powerful way to reach users because they can be delivered even when the user is not actively using the device, which increases the chances of the user seeing and interacting with the ad. They can also be targeted to specific users based on demographic or behavioral data, which increases the chances of the ad being relevant to the user.
